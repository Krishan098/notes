# Tool Calling/Function calling

- Many AI applications interact directly with humans. In these cases, it is appropriate for models to respond in natural language. But what about cases where we want a model to also interact directly with systems, such as databases or an API? These systems often have a particular input schema; for example, APIs frequently have a required payload structure. This need motivates the concept of tool calling.

## Key concepts:

1. Tool Creation: use the @tool decorator to create a tool. A tool is an association between a function and it's schema.

2. Tool Binding: The tool needs to be connected to a model that supports tool calling. This gives the model awareness of the tool and the associated input schema required by the tool.

3. Tool Calling: When appropriate, the model can decide to call a tool and ensure its response conforms the tool's input schema. 

4. Tool Execution: The tool can be executed using the arguments provided by the model.

## Tool calling

- A key principle of tool calling is that the model decides when to use a tool based on the input's relevance. The model doesn't always need to call a tool.

## Tool execution
- they can be directly invoked
