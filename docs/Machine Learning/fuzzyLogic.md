# Fuzzy Logic

- fuzzy logic is a way to model logical reasoning where the truth of a statement is not binary.

- A fuzzy inference system is a form of artificial intelligence(mimics the way humans approach solving problems)

- It is a way to encode this experience-based knowledge in the form of logical rules.

- encoding of knowledge that can be used for predictions.

- need to consider the impreciseness of language to correctly encode them.

- crisp input-> fuzzification(fuzzifier)->fuzzy logic rules(Inference)->Defuzzification->crisp output.

- we can approach the problem in the opposite cirection

- A fuzzy inference system: a framework with unknown rules and membership functions.
